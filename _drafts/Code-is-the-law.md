Inspired by a dialogue in pirates of the caribbean.

code is the law

The computers are dumb. At they are now. I don’t know about future. They are designed to be dumb. They just follow what you tell them to do. Obviously you’d program them. This is how we get our work done with a computer.

Now because computing is everything. Computing merges with our lives. Now we outsource our tedious tasks to those dumb devices. And now there is a need of how we do it. Whether yo are working (the problem) on simple utility, mobile application or financial applications or industry robots or modern Ai systems. You need to understand that you need to do it well. For computers your code is the law. They follow it whatever happens, they are designed to be like that. Failing to produce law that has lot of loop holes or that doesn’t consider all necessary scenarios will make you pay the price. Also those laws needs to be amended with latest situations. Those laws won’t be valid forever. So, constant urge of having to improvise the law is recommended.

Now in the ever increasing business in digital world. or time to market. we’ll need to produce software very quickly. And you not only you produce software. It is a group of people who does it. It is the product of group of people. 

Majorly here what we discuss is about how you do it technically. May b e the problem you are solving is of a particular domain. Is your `technical solution` is covering all the scenarios `technically` or is the law ready to be extended with minimal effect. You may cover all scenarios that the problem poses and you should also cover all the scenarios the technical world poses to your solution. You need to consider that also. Technically how easy it is to extend the code to fit new feature determines efficient time usage. You need to do it properly if not perfectly. There may be a new person trying to extend your code. So, while developing the product owner needs to consider all these.

- Technical scenarios posed (security related) etc., like non-functional requirements.
- Some nice process so that new joined works well


To solve these problem we have many tools. Lot of tools, linting, security analyzers, tools to improve the usability of particular language (these are mostly helpful in teams). May be incorporate those tools to be effective. No need to use all of them. Lot of fancy name buzzwords. May be understand them. Understand what problems they would solve. And if you feel that is your problem. use it. Development processes, tools can’t name them. Understand your scenario. Team size, tech stack, situation of existing codebase. delivery deadlines consider all those and choose those tools that helps you.

ofcouse lifetime of software is tend to be less. But it has to be good and extendible.

So have the constant urge to produce better code. Because code is the law and it has to be …. you know. Then you will produce the software that is close to be good.

Development/delivery team should have constant urge to produce good code.
There are many processes defined to follow.
