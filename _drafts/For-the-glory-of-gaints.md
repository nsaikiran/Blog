_[**If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants.**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants)
should explain the title. There are so many giants. Everyone I've learned from counts and I don't even know their names.
Even you don't remember the giants you've learned from. But they shall be remembered.

I should have wrote this few years ago, during my undergraduate studies.
Because it was then I felt this.

See, for everything to be understood there needs a tiny spark of thought
that convinces you. That spark is very important. If you managed to get that
it means you understood well.

Generally I would give my first preference to a writing by the creator, if available.
For better understanding.

When we were spending lot of time on doing some stuff in HTML and feeling
happy. And worked with Python. Loved it.

Later introduced to C programming language. Felt unusual because at that
time transiting from Python to C is [difficult](2015-01-07-A-Difficult-thing-for-beginners.md)

As I was exploring C, I understood many concepts that make up software systems as we see them today.
[ The C Programming Language ](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/515601.The_C_Programming_Language)
book by Dennis M. Ritchie and Brian Kernighan helped me soo much. It explains C language in conjunction with UNIX concepts.
That book is concise, precise and always top my favorite books list.
In fact every book by [Brian Kernighan ](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~bwk/) is worth reading.

Soon after I've learned the still living impact of C language and UNIX philosophy,
I had to do this drawing and stick in my class room.

C language also played important role in development of UNIX operating system.
Developed by  Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie and others.
We all know that the [Unix philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) will definitely guide us through better software development.

You *must* see these videos about UNIX:

[UNIX pipe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(Unix)) contributed by Douglas McIlroy is still favorite of many people out there.
