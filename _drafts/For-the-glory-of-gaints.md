I should have wrote this few years ago, when I was studying my graduation.
Because it was then I did all this.

See, for everything to be understood there needs a tiny spark of thought
that convinces you. That spark is very important. If you managed to get that
it means you understood well.

Generally I would give my first preference to a writing by the creator, if available.
For better understanding.

When we were spending lot of time on doing some stuff in HTML and feeling
happy. And worked with Python. Loved it.

Later introduced to C programming language. Felt unusual because at that
time transiting from Python to C is [difficult](2015-01-07-A-Difficult-thing-for-beginners.md)

As I was exploring C, I understood many concepts that make up software systems as we see them today.
