Webpage is marked up using tags

-----------------
That was really fun playing with html during the early days of engineering.
But after sometime I was starting to work with web. Understanding how web 
pages are created. 

**Write something  more here**

It seemed I have to learn HTML, [CSS][] and JavaScript &mdash; 3 different 
languages, to create a web page. What? I didn't know that. So, wanted to 
figure out *why*. 

When we describe [HTML][] &mdash; *[Hypertext][] [Markup][] Language*, it 
seemed it can alone define a webpage &mdash; including elements, styles and 
in my opinion &mdash; dynamic behavior as well.


So, why should we learn three different languages. Finally I found the answer 
here at [Web Standards][] &mdash; And it says `Theyâ€™re simply an evolution of the web`.


We have HTML, CSS and JavaScript &mdash; the building blocks of 
the World Wide Web, to create stylish and interactive webpages.
  
First came HTML, with structure and styles and layout. Then Styles and layout 
were separated in to CSS.

CSS was born by seperation of layout information from the *then* HTML.

JavaScript was born to provide interactivity to the web pages. It is mainly used for 
DOM manipulations &mdash; Changing webpage's content, style and layout based on user's 
interaction.
 
You specify `what` in HTML and `how` in CSS and JavaScript, depending on the what you are 
trying to do: styling and layout, or behavior.

HTML is just like manuscript markup.

Sometimes we tend to write CSS and/or JavaScript in HTML file. It seems OK but not. 
Because then rather than *what* you are writing *how*. Then the file will be clumsy with 
*what* and *how*.

That is the reason they are separated.

-----------
 HTML is used to build the skeleton. CSS is used to position and color the 
 components of the page. Finally, JavaScript is used for DOM manipulations 
 (It was intended for tasks for which Java was too heavy).
----------- 
 So I referred definitions. Then I felt there should not be 3 different 
 languages because the acronym HTML -- Hypertext Markup Language, according 
 to its name it should have features of CSS and JavaScript as well. *Because we are using CSS and JavaScript for **Markup***
 
 
 The evolution of these technologies is different.
Componets of web: HTML CSS Javascript.

First I wanted to have a clear idea of what is HTML and what is not.
Clear separation of these technologies. I don't know why I wanted to do that. But I wanted. And I started
