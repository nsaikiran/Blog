#Annotations
Annotations have been very handy in influence the definitions. Now we use them everywhere. 
Especially in configuring Spring. 
I was curious to know how they those annotations work on our piece of code. I came to know that this is a weird and unusual concept.
Anyway, [Annotation Processing][Annotation Processing 101] gives some insights in to processing annotations.

#Spring

#SpringBoot
They say it is a opinionated configuration of Spring. You can change that by customizing.
Checkout these two videos:
- [Demystifying SpringBoot Magic][Demystifying SpringBoot Magic].
- [Zero Effort Spring][Zero Effort Spring].


This post will be as much generic as Spring/Spring Boot it self ;). It doesn't include all specific details.



I hope I've tried to uncover at least few of the magic curtains if not some.
