This post will is review of the book: Understanding the digital world.


I read this eventhough I felt reading this book won't give me much new technical insights.
insights. I was sure I'll enjoy his writing.
Wanted to know what he is going to tell.
The way he organized the content is awesome.
Kernighan is my favorite author.
Here, in [Q&A with Kernighan][Q&A with Kernighan], the author tells you why you need to read this book.
In my opinion you'll get a clear and smooth/continuous information on digital world right from the bare hardware to security/privacy issues we are facing currently.
I even felt like revising most of concepts learned in college &mdash; I would consider this as a handbook.
And, everything is about terms,words,abbreviations that are buzzing around &mdash; you better know them and understand the context around them,
hence I was also thinking if I can get to know some of those to chase.
And this book is intended for people *not* necessarily having tech background, I wanted to understand how he tried to explain.


Organization of content in the book is simple. He organized into 3 major parts: Hardware, Software and Communcations.
He introduces the digital world from organization of computer hardware, through various levels of software,
programming and programming languages, networks that made communication possible, the web and security and privacy problems we are facing.
Necessary history, recent events and his own opinions made the text more interesting.
During explanation, he draws a historical timeline till where we are right now &mdash; And it is always interesting to know about evolution.



I got introduced to some new terms. Got good context around some terms I already know.
I would highly recommend it, if you wanted to know how the digital world works the way it is &mdash; with decent level of detail.
Above all I enjoyed his writing.

I consider this as a Handbook of fundamentals of technology.

I've noted some new terms to go after, to know more.

work towards privacy, security. He gives some tips he follows.
