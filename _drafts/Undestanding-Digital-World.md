Kernighan is my favorite author.
Recently I've finished his book on technology around us,
**Understanding the Digital World: What You Need to Know about Computers, the Internet, Privacy, and Security**.


The author in his words at [Q&A with Kernighan][Q&A with Kernighan] explains,
who might be interested in reading this book and what they would get.
I was expecting to have a smooth explanation of digital world around us.
There are so many terms, words, abbreviations that are buzzing around &mdash;
it is important that we know them and understand the context around them.
Hence I was also thinking if I can get to know some of those buzz words to chase.
As this book is intended for the people *not* necessarily having tech background,
I wanted to understand at what detail he tried to explain.



right from the bare hardware to security/privacy issues we are facing currently.



Organization of content in the book is simple.
It has three major parts: Hardware, Software and Communcations.
With this content Kernighan introduces the digital world from the organization of computer hardware,
through various levels of software,
programming and programming languages, networks that made communication possible, the web as we see it today
and security and privacy problems we are facing.
Necessary history, recent events and his own opinions made the text more interesting.
During explanation, he draws a historical timeline till where we are right now &mdash;
And it is always interesting to know about evolution.
He introduces the legal concepts in technical world.



I got introduced to some new terms. Got good context around some terms I already know.
I felt like revising most of concepts learned in college &mdash;
I would consider this as a handbook.
I would highly recommend it, if you wanted to know how the digital world works the way it is &mdash; with decent level of detail.
Above all I enjoyed his writing.
