## JavaScript
JavaScript execution model is better explained in [Concurrency model and Event Loop][Concurrency model and Event Loop].
Because it runs on single thread it may needs to run instructions [asynchronously][asynchronous]; otherwise you'll end up in 
non-responsive runtime. 
If you want to understand event loop properly 
then you would never want to miss this awesome presentation named *[In the Loop][In the Loop]*. 
You'll enjoy that presentation.
