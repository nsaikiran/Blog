How IO devices work?
What are interrupts?
How they are processed by Computer?
What is concurrent execution?


How modern computer processor works?


Finish the [https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer) course before writing this long & 
detailed writing about what neeeds to be understood. [Syllabus](https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/44046b_9b60bbc2723a435db664fa0faa4dc645.pdf)

Concepts of computers:
- How CPU works [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNN_tTXABUA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNN_tTXABUA)
- Abstraction: [The Law of Leaky Abstractions](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/)
- concurrent vs parallel
    - [Concurrent vs parallel](https://blog.golang.org/concurrency-is-not-parallelism): Mention ideas
- starting from multi programming, multi-user os, and essential ideas about conconcurreny and prallelism.
