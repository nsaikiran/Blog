## Follow the guidelines to be understood
You are about to accomplish something. 
You know 'clearly' what you want. 
You are gonna need help in this process. You know who can help. 
Then you need to know how to communicate you need. 
The crucial part is how you are going to communicate your need. 

If that is a computer you are trying to communicate with, 
you are expected to follow some `guidelines` to be understood properly.

Those `guidelines` are everything for computers. 
Those guidelines need to be properly designed, understood and used.

The point I'm trying to make here is, one can use this guidelines concept to 
better interfaces.

The programs, configuration files and all of the software that I know has concrete `guidelines` 
to communicate with them.

> And we are expected to follow the `guidelines`.

## The way of perceiving
- How data is interpreted? 
- How come we have these many variety of data types and file types.

For example most of the programs expect `arguements` in string format. 
Those arguments are stored in an understood location. In the program we 
take those arguments and even change the type of data in those arguments 
to accommodate required operations. 

What can we understand by looking at the extension of the file is that it defines 
how to generate such a file and read it. A video/audio file can't be opened by a text editor.
Because text editor is designed to understand and generate a plain text file.
And VLC media player can be used to generate and play media files. **File Formats** 
is the magic there. We use **file format** specification to generate and read files.
That is the reason for every file format we have a different software. All files 
have same representation in memory. But the way of perceiving is different, which is defined as file format specification.

> The specification of file format is a happy handshake between encoder and decoder.

-----------

Those guidelines are defined by readers. 
Readers are designed in such way that they work with 
If you don't follow the guidelines they yell at you. 
You are expected to follow those guidelines for an accomplishment.
Be friendly with the reader otherwise they will yell.

Are you communicating whatever you are trying to communicate properly.?

We have different file formats for different types of files like text, video, image etc.
Or same type of file with added guidelines html, py etc.

The specification of file format is happy handshake between encoder and decoder.


## You are expected!

Why you experience, any sort of error during software production and execution?

Have you tried configuring/customizing any software you are using? In that process what you observe?

Have you worked with these so called frameworks that are born to assist the software development?

> What are all these have in common?
 
> > `You are expected to follow the guidelines for an accomplishment.`

Even we find intermediate systems that ensures all the assumptions are properly met before actually passing on to subsequent system.
Because assumptions in way makes good systems.

  
Why this discussion?
It will be really helpful, to understand `whatever you are expected to do`
while dealing with something.



I'm trying to explain the interfaces.

I feel communicating your need to a computer is not so complex

If it is another human you are trying to, then how the communicated is perceived is important.
Because the ability to perceive is `subjective`, as everything related to humans &mdash; is.
As humans we try to cover most of the scenarios in agreements.
