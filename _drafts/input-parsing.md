## 
How data is interpreted? How come you have these many variety of data types and file types.
What do you mean encoding? 


Those guidelines are defined by readers. Readers are designed in such way that they work with 
If you don't follow the guidelines they yell at you. 
You are expected to follow those guidelines for an accomplishment.
Be friendly with the reader otherwise they will yell.

Are you communicating whatever you are trying to communicate properly.?

We have different file formats for different types of files like text, video, image etc.
Or same type of file with added guidelines html, py etc.

The specification of file format is happy handshake between encoder and decoder.


## You are expected!

Why you experience, any sort of error during software production and execution?


Have you tried configuring/customizing any software you are using? In that process what you observe?

Have you worked with these so called frameworks that are born to assist the software development?

Even we find intermediate systems that ensures all the assumptions are properly met before actually passing on to subsequent system.
Because assumptions in way makes good systems.

  
Why this discussion?
It will be really helpful, to understand `whatever you are expected to do`
while dealing with something.

## TODO
### How the file formatting works?
### How the data is understood and interpreted?
### Character encoding.
