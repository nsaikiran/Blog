Language and terms and their effects: based on speech by Usha ramanathan @ away day

Even in general sense, I came to know indtroducing and removing vocabulary will make 
significant impact. As those phrases are used to discuss about, ideate around that is being named.

TODO: name of book
Sometimes while using a term I really worried if I know what that name actually means. 
There are so many names people use daily. Sometimes I'm worried If I should actually know all of 
the words and their meaning.

For sometime I've started hating words, may be because I couldn't follow up on many words produced. 
Then I've decided

May be because if we don't name certain phenomenon people won't discuss about that. 

[Name It, and They Will Come](https://overreacted.io/name-it-and-they-will-come/)  explains *why* 
naming is important. I think the *names* or buzzwords are created to recognize that particular 
phenomenon. Even though that buzzwords in not addressing a phenmenon that is drastic from the one
 you alreday know. They might want that small difference to be recognized by their name.
 
So, names or buzzwords are not evil. You just need to make sure what exactly being addressed with
 that name.
