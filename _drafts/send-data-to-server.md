## Sending data to server
While dealing with web, and using javascript we prefer 
using ajax to make calls to server.

We have this data exchange format coming in: JSON. 
Powering up [RESETful API][RESETful API].

I wanted to POST an array of string to server. Faced 
some error as I was not sure of allowed data types. 
Then I had to read [Ajax API][Ajax API]. To actually know how 
to do that.
