Felt the proliferation and fast pacing development of technologies. 
Everything does seem to *change*. We can't rely on something for longtime.
In response to that and for better understanding &mdash; I started discussing. 

Here is the listing of `opinions` that are shared with me regarding
> ## Proliferation and fast pacing development of technologies.


### Categorize the technology choices based on *domains*.

Don't feel overwhelmed with technology choices.
Sometimes we might feel overwhelmed with the technology choices that are available to solve a particular problem.
Because they have some similar features.
But Each domain has it specific tools to solve the problems.
We have to understand that we have good number of options to solve a problem in a domain.

### Don't ask people to stop thinking. People think and create stuff.

People think and invent or improve stuff, that is how we progress. 
We need to invent new technologies for better experience or improve existing tools.
They keep on doing it.

### Do not master any particular tool. Master the concepts.

Mastering or adapting a particular tool will limit the scope of awareness on choices.
I've seen people who, haven't heard of other paradigms or tools to solve problems 
that are similar to problems they solve with *their tool*.
You should not master a tool, rather you should master the concepts.
Try to master a concept with the help of a tool of your choice, 
with the awareness of other similar options and trade-offs you've considered.
Then you can adapt any technology easily 
because the technologies rely on concepts.

> ## Is the industry preferring *generalists* to *specialists*?

The answer is *NO*.
As generalists can welcome agility and take advantage of new tools, 
these days people feel being a generalist is better.
But specialists are really important. 
We need their specialized experience for successful delivery.
Specialists should enchance their fitness with trends.

Anyway, this discussion is about **my** technology**landscape**.
> `Update your technology landscape! It is important.`

I also feel that the urge to go to market before anyone else does with the similar 
technology is also a reason. Creators want to let the people know &mdash; as early as possible, 
that there is a technology available. And let it *evolve* over time.

*why* the architecture should be *evolving*.

What about the people those have worked exclusively on particular 
technology stack. It won't be so easy for them to adapt any other.
 
At the end we have to update ourselves with the latest technology trends. 

Overwhelming number of technologies to pick.
Short life time of tech/library.
Frequent updates with new features. 


 Why software with frequent updates?



As a specialist one might be working on a specific domain or technology. 
One has to sustain the speciality by adapting the new trends in the respective domains/technologies. 
Because some of the opinions suggest that industry is looking 
for generalists, those who can adapt/work with breadth of technologies, than specialists to welcome agility in 
the flow take advantage of the latest technology tools.


Understanding the latest tech trends, and adapting the same is very important 
to prove your fitness in industry. So, do whatever you can do to achieve that.
