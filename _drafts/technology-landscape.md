Trying to understand this fast pacing technology proliferation that I feel bothering many people. Is everyone working
 in the industry is trying to keep up with this? How to understand this? As a developer should I need to understand 
 every new library/technology that is coming every day at least in my domain? What about the people those have worked 
 exclusively on particular technology stack. What they have to ?
 
At the end we have to update ourselves with the latest technology trends. But you may want to look 


Here is a listing of opinions collected. These can be input for better understanding.

The question:

What is your opinion on this fast pacing technologies?
Overwhelming number of technologies to pick.
Short life time of tech/library.
Frequent updates with new features.


# Opinion 1
Each domain has it specific tools to solve the problems. If we consider all the tools that are available it seems we have too many tools to master.
But we have to understand that we have good number of options to solve a problem in a domain.
We have many options to solve a problem related to a domain.
For each domain we have my tools available to solve the problems.

# Opinion 2
Don't ask people to stop thinking. People think and create stuff.

People think and invent stuff, that is how we progress. We need to invent new technologies for better experience or improve existing tools.

They keep on doing it.

# Opinion 3
You should not master the tool, rather you should master the concepts.
Your expertise should not be specific to a tool, rather you should 
have generalized expertise in concepts. Then you can adopt any tech easily 
because the concepts that tools rely on will mostly be same or induced 
from existing ones.

# Opinion 4
You have to do it. Otherwise you will be fired from the industry.
Understanding the latest tech trends, and adopting the same is very important 
to prove your fitness in industry. So, do whatever you can do to achieve that.

# Opinion 5
What about a specialist? 
As a specialist we might be working on a specific domain or technology. One has to sustain the speciality by 
adopting the new trends in the respective domains/technologies. At the end specialists are really important 
to have bigger picture and successful product. Because some of the opinions suggest that industry is looking 
for generalists, those who can adopt/work with breadth of technologies, than specialists to welcome agility in 
the flow take advantage of the latest technology tools.
