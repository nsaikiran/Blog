Felt the proliferation and fast pacing development of technologies. 
Everything does seem to *change*. We can't rely on something for longtime.

In response to that and for better understanding, I started discussing.

Here is the listing of `opinions` that are shared with me regarding
> Proliferation and fast pacing development of technologies.


## Categorize the technology choices based on *domains*.

Don't feel overwhelmed with technology choices.
Sometimes we might feel overwhelmed with the technology choices that are available to solve a particular problem.
Because they have some interesectiong features.
Each domain has it specific tools to solve the problems.
But we have to understand that we have good number of options to solve a problem in a domain.

Why many tools with similar features? Why software with frequent updates?

The answer is: 

## Don't ask people to stop thinking. People think and create stuff.

People think and invent or improve stuff, that is how we progress. We need to invent new technologies for better experience or improve existing tools.

They keep on doing it.

## Do not master any particular tool. Master the concepts.

Mastering or adopting a particular tool will limit the scope of awareness on choices.
I've seen people who, haven't heard of other paradigms or tools to solve problems that are similar to problems they solve with *their tool*.

You should may be master a concept with the help of a tool of your choice, with the awareness of other similar options and trade-offs you've considered.


You should not master the tool, rather you should master the concepts.
Your expertise should not be specific to a tool, rather you should 
have generalized expertise in concepts. Then you can adopt any tech easily 
because the concepts that tools rely on will mostly be same or induced 
from existing ones.

# Opinion 4
What about a specialist?

As a specialist we might be working on a specific domain or technology. One has to sustain the speciality by 
adopting the new trends in the respective domains/technologies. At the end specialists are really important 
to have bigger picture and successful product. Because some of the opinions suggest that industry is looking 
for generalists, those who can adopt/work with breadth of technologies, than specialists to welcome agility in 
the flow take advantage of the latest technology tools.



    You have to do it. Otherwise you will be fired from the industry.

Understanding the latest tech trends, and adopting the same is very important 
to prove your fitness in industry. So, do whatever you can do to achieve that.

I feel, `reaching the market` before your competitor does also places a major role in this *rapidly evolving* nature of products.

Consider the above points as input to form a opinion on *Technology Landscape*. To help yourself to not to lost in that.

Anyway, this is the discussion about only technology *landscape*.

What about the people those have worked exclusively on particular 
technology stack. It won't be so easy for them to adopt any other.
 
At the end we have to update ourselves with the latest technology trends. 

Overwhelming number of technologies to pick.
Short life time of tech/library.
Frequent updates with new features.
