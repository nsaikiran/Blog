Trying to understand this fast pacing technology prolifiration that I feel bothering many people. Is everyone working
 in the industry is trying to keep up with this? How to understand this? As a developer should I need to understand 
 every new library/technology that is coming every day atleast in my domain? What about the people those have worked 
 exclusively on particular technology stack. What they have to ?
 
At the end we have to update ourselves with the latest technology trends. But you may want to look 


 
# Opinion 1
Each domain has it specific tools to solve the problems. If we consider all the tools that are available it seems we have too many tools to master.
But we have to understand that we have good number of options to solve a problem in a domain.
We have many options to solve a problem related to a domain.
For each domain we have my tools available to solve the problems.

# Opinion 2
Don't ask people to stop thinking. People think and create stuff.

People think and invent stuff, that is how we progress. We need to invent new technologies for better experience or improve existing tools.

They keep on doing it.

# Opinion 3
You should not master the tool, rather you should master the concepts.
Your expertise should not be specific to a tool, rather you should 
have generalized expertise in concepts. Then you can adopt any tech easily 
because the concepts that tools rely on will mostly be same or induced 
from existing ones.

# Opinion 4
You have to do it. Otherwise you will be fired from the industry.
