# Opinion 1
We have many options to solve a problem related to a domain.
For each domain we have my tools available to solve the problems.

# Opinion 2
Don't ask people to stop thinking. People think and create stuff.
They keep on doing it.

# Opinion 3
You should not master the tool, rather you should master the concepts.
Your expertise should not be specific to a tool, rather you should 
have generalized expertise in concepts. Then you can adopt any tech easily 
because the concepts that tools rely on will mostly be same or induced 
from existing ones.

# Opinion 4
You have to do it. Otherwise you will be fired from the industry.
