Learning a programming language is same as `learning any natural language`. Except programming language have negligible amount of  special
words and no ambiguity. `Grammar` and `language specification/standard` are major ingredients here.

You can be a poet on the other side of the language, but to reach there
I strongly believe that you have to go through them: language specification/standard and grammar. Because all your questions/doubtscan be *answered* with them.
It is a bit difficult to understand them because they are
intended(mainly) for language implementors, who are assumed to have sound knowledge. **But being a poet counts.** :)
