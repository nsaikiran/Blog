*[If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants)
should explain the title. Everyone I've learned from counts. I don't even know their names because there are so many of them.
But they shall be remembered :pray: .*

I should have written this a couple of years ago, during my undergraduate studies.
Because it was then I felt this.

There are times where you'll dream of writing those complex applications while
you are practicing programs -- for example a program to add to two integers :sweat_smile:
.
But it will definitely take some time to realise that
it'll take good amount of knowledge of underlying systems to work on
complex applications.

There was a feeling of [discomfort]({{'/cs/2015/01/07/A-Difficult-thing-for-beginners.html' | absolute_url }}) for me
while learning C after practicing Python.
Because Python seemed far easier than C with lot of built-in constructs.
But that *discomfort* made me question those high-level constructs.
That questioning helped me understanding the motivation and design behind
those high-level constructs.

As I was exploring C, I had an opportunity to understand many concepts that make up software systems as we see them today.
[ The C Programming Language ](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/515601.The_C_Programming_Language)
book by Dennis M. Ritchie and Brian Kernighan helped me so much.
It explains C language in conjunction with the UNIX concepts.
That book is concise, precise and always tops my favorite books list.
In fact every book by [Brian Kernighan ](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~bwk/) is worth reading.

C language also played an important role in development of the UNIX operating system.
We all know that the [Unix philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy)
is a good guide for software development.


[UNIX pipe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(Unix)) contributed by Douglas McIlroy is still favorite of many people out there.
- [Unix Pipeline (Brian Kernighan) - Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKzonnwoR2I).
    In this video  Brian Kernighan explains the motivation behind the UNIX pipe.


Documentaries about UNIX:
- [UNIX: Making Computers Easier To Use -- AT&T Archives film from 1982, Bell Laboratories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvDZLjaCJuw).
- [AT&T Archives: The UNIX Operating System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tc4ROCJYbm0)

Soon after I've learned the still living impact of C language and the UNIX philosophy,
I had to do this drawing and stick in my class room.
