To get the linear time complexity while solving some problems on arrays or linked lists, we can use _two-pointers_ technique.

## Problems

- Given an array find if there exists two numbers that sum to given K.
  - Sort the array and use two pointers from both ends.
- Remove duplicates from a sorted array/linked list.
- Transform the given array: Even numbers should be in the first half and odd number will be the sencond half.
- Pivoting of linked list (EPI Python)
