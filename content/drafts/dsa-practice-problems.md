## Problems to practive
- Classify elements in the array. Given an array classify the numbers as even, odd. Put all even numbers to the start of the array and odd numbers to the end. EPI arrays
- Find sum of most K recent numbers of a stream
Given a stream and when asked about most recent numbers, circular queue can be used know the implementation. Like moving sum or average etc
- Range sum problem
Given a array of numbers, implement some queries. Like rank of a given number, least number greater than some K, or greatest number less than K etc. Sort the array and do some preprocessing that will same somtime. This is on a static array, if that is a stream then we need to use someother approaches.
- Quick sort and merge sort code. Review once and write. How the merge step and pivot selection and placing it in right spot helps.
- H-Index problem: https://leetcode.com/problems/h-index/description/
- LRU cache implementation - ADT
- [LFU cache implementation - ADT](https://arpitbhayani.me/blogs/lfu/)
- Application of Ordered Set and its implementation. Python has OrderedDict,deque. Differences and their benefits.
- NGE using stacks
- Problems from https://github.com/Chanda-Abdul/Several-Coding-Patterns-for-Solving-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-Problems-during-Interviews
    - all sections atleast 2 questions or 2 model of questions



## Previous questions
- Given a set of cartesian points, generate the bounding box that includes all the points.
- Given two strings, and we can cut the strings at same position. After cut we take the left half of the first string and right part of the second string and join them to form a new string. How many of those new strings are plindromes - https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/109662/divide-two-strings-to-form-palindrome 
- Given a string with limited number of characters repeating. Find the number of substrings where the count of all allowed characters is same in the substring.
    -  Ex: RBRRB https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22604728/finding-substring-with-equal-number-of-characters 
- General json validation: string processing. Should have covered all of the edge cases. And validated the approached up front. So that I was confident while coding.
- Given start binary pattern and destination binary pattern, see if we can reach from start pattern to end, in each step only one bit can be flipped. Also given a set of safe states through which you should be traversing. Moving to a non-safe pattern in invalid. https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-experience/515564/google-l3-hyderabad-feb-2020-rejected lock round 5
- Given a dictionary of words, suggest the user words based first few characters typed, like the functionality in mobile phone typing scenario.
