> As a software engineer, I solve problems and write code to scale solutions.

Understanding the problem and solving it is a cruicial and relevant skil and once the solution is prepared -- it can be scaled. With latest advancement of technology it is going to be easy to use the technology to get the known facts/solutions. But the skill to see the patterns/solving new problems will always be relevant. So, focus on the problem and understand it well.

Based on the requirement any technology can be learned.
